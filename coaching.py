    In addition to taking input, you are required to handle domain errors as well
    For example: the SSN should be only 9 characters long
    Sex should be only M or F
    If you choose to take Super_SSN, you need to make sure the foreign key constraint is satisfied
    HINT: Instead of handling all these errors yourself, you can make use of except clause to print the error returned to you by MySQL
